#Project Overview

As part of my Data Representation and Querying Module I was asked to design an **API** for a Dataset but not to actually implement it. This API's main goal is to let the users access information that will be useful to them. It will be easy to use and also be user-friendly. The Dataset was accessed through [Data.Gov.ie] (https://data.gov.ie/data) and I was then sent to the [Irish Prisons website] (http://www.irishprisons.ie).

#The DATASET

The DATASET used is in PDF format, it can be found on the [Irish Prisons Statistics] (http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/statistics) web page.</br>
