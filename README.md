# *Data Representation Project 2015*
## Prison Committals and Population

**Course:** Software Development </br>

**Lecturer:** Dr.Ian Mcloughlin </br>

#Project Overview

As part of my Data Representation and Querying Module I was asked to design an **API** for a Dataset but not to actually implement it. This API's main goal is to let the users access information that will be useful to them. It will be easy to use and also be user-friendly. The Dataset was accessed through [Data.Gov.ie] (https://data.gov.ie/data) and I was then sent to the [Irish Prisons website] (http://www.irishprisons.ie). 

In the first part (GET method) I will be focusing on User side of the application. 
In the second part I will present the POST, DELETE and PUT methods, this part will apply to the Admin side or the developer side. Why would the second part not apply to standard users? Simply because we cannot have anyone just adding/ editing information in the dataset. This DataSet must remain credible source of information.

#The DATASET

The DATASET used is in PDF format, it can be found on the [Irish Prisons Statistics] (http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/statistics) web page.</br> 
Data Contains Information about:

  * Prison Commitals
  * Prison Population

Persons committed each year from **2007 to 2014** BY: 
* [Age/Gender] (http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/annualstats/age_gender_2007_2014.pdf) of person commited
* [Address] (http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/annualstats/county_commitals_year_2008_2014.pdf) Given by persons commited by County 
* [Nationality](http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/annualstats/nationality_commitals_year_2008_2014.pdf) of person commited



##METHODS

*Method* | *Account*
---------|----------
GET| Requests data from a specified resource
POST| Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
DELETE| Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI
PUT| Creates/ Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.


####**Quick Overview of the Methods named**
#####**GET**
*  Can be bookmarked/cached.
*  Parameters remain in browser history. 
*  Data is visible to everyone in the URL.
*  GET -less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL. 
*  Never send sensitive info such as password.

#####**PUT**
*  Canot be bookmarked and is NOT cached.
*  Parameters are NOT saved in browser history. 
*  Data is NOT displayed in the URL.
*  No data length restriction.
*  POST is a safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs.
*  Never send sensitive info such as password.

##*POST*
------
#### 1. **ADDING persons commited to prison by AGE and GENDER 2007-2014**
If for example, new year starts or administrators will want to include data from previous years (<2007) that can be done using the **POST** method. </br>

I will show below an example of **URL** that could be responsible for this.

**NOTE:** URL's with ID are only available to system administrators or people that have previously logged in to their accounts providing that their accounts are with special rights. 
Ordinary User will not be able to do anything without obtaining privilege option.

**URL:** ```http://irishprisons.ie/commitals/2/addyear```  *2 = ID of the table, this will direct the admin to this specific table*

First **request will be sent** to add a year column to the table.
```
POST /addyear/newyear_table HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.irishprisons.ie
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Accept-Language: en-us
year="2014"&Male=" "&Female=" "&Total=" "
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

After we would **receive** this kind of response: 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: 17:16:00 11 November 9 2015

<h1>Column added successfully</h1>

```


**Note: the task will be similar for adding information to the other tables as well, writing them up makes me feel like I'm mostly wasting readers time and just making the project longer and more complicated in genera. I want to keep things clear and easy to follow, Thank You**




##*PUT*
------
#### 2. **UPDATING data about persons commited to prison by NATIONALITY 2007-2014**
Let's say now the developer wants to send some info about updating the table at the root of the server, hw can do this through the PUT method. Best idea is to use PUT when you can update a resource completely through a specific resource. You would do this only if you know the specific location of this. Below I will show example of specific item in the URL...</br>
```http://irishprisons.ie/commitals/3/updateyear``` *3 = ID of the NATIONALITY dataset.* 


I will show below an example of **URL** that could be responsible for this.

**URL:** ```http://irishprisons.ie/commitals/3/updateyear```  *3 = ID of the table, this will direct the admin to this specific table*

First **request will be sent** to update a year column to the table.
```
PUT /year.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.irishprisons.ie
Accept-Language: en-us
updateyear="2014"&Nationality Group=" "&Irish=" "&UK=" "&Other European=" "&African=" "&Asian=" "&Australian=" "&South American=" "&North American=" "&Not Recorded=" "&TOTAL=" "
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-type: text/html

```

After we would **receive** this kind of response: 

```
